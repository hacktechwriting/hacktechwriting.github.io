# Hello World

If you've ever studied a programming language, you know that printing "Hello World" is Exercise #1 in the programming course. Getting the computer to say "Hello World" is your first step in showing the computer who's boss and moving toward mastery as a programmer.

Why do I mention this? Well, I'm a technical writer who is going to show you different ways of using your computer to refine your documentation, discover problems you didn't know existed, and generally raise the level of quality in the content you develop. At the same time, I'll talk about different ways of structuring and presenting your content to deliver information in a way your users will love.

I'm a huge consumer of technical writing. On a daily basis, I'm searching the web for information on some programming issue, or referring to [safaribooksonline.com](http://safaribooksonline.com) in search of a more elegant solution to some problem. The more technical writing I consume, the more I question how most of today's content comes about and the priorities of the writers who author the content.

Not long ago, the technical writing profession was populated with writers expert in crafting grammatically correct sentences and entering them in their company's authoring tool of choice. Yet, I wonder if most technical writers have ever done a sustained deep dive into a technical manual in order to master a technical subject or software tool. Yes, technical writing should be grammatically correct and use good sentence structure. But in my experience, the writing itself is less important than the accuracy and completeness of the content, the organization of the material, and the quality of the examples. The writers of [Developing Quality Technical Information: A Handbook for Writers and Editors](http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Quality-Technical-Information-Handbook/dp/0131477498) certainly understood this when they advocated a minimalist style. Readers don't want to wade through gobs of text, they just want to get to the command, options, menu pick, process, or technique that will get the job done for them.

Like lines of code in program, less writing is more if it serves the same function. Leave the superfluous adverbs and adjectives to Marketing, and let's focus on the core information our users need. Lets strive to make the writing accurate, and precise, with just as many words as are required to convey the message.

I have an audacious goal for you: make quality and accuracy a priority in your documentation. In the coming posts, I'll share with you some simple tools and techniques to raise the quality of your documentation. By sharing this information with others in your organization, you can help them at the same time.

Let's get started!
