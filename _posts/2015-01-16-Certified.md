When I first started Technical Writing, my boss asked me to take a grammar class at University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Extension. I enjoyed the class, and decided to pursue the full certificate. Ten classes and two years later, I completed the entire program and received my certificate.

You can read more about the certificate program at [http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/programs/technical-writing](http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/programs/technical-writing). To receive a certificate, you must complete 7 required and 3 elective classes. I chose the following classes:

<ul>
<li>Information Architecture</li>
<li>Grammar and Style for Technical Communicators</li>
<li>Technical Communication: An Introduction to the Profession</li>
<li>Technical Writers’ Workshop</li>
<li>Writing Successful Instructions, Procedures and Policies</li>
<li>Developing Technical Information from Plan to Completion</li>
<li>Minimalist Design for Documentation</li>
<li>Graphic Design Fundamentals</li>
<li>Content Management</li>
<li>DITA Authoring, Introduction</li>
<li>Final Project</li>
</ul>

Was it worth it? Some classes were certainly more informative and interesting than others. There were some repetition of material, but the feedback from the instructors and other students really helped me to hone my writing. It was also helpful to gain exposure to newer topics in technical writing, such as DITA. Overall, I’m glad I invested the time, it was definitely worth the effort.

It helped that my company was paying the tuition of around $600 per class. Surprisingly, I’m one of the rare exceptions in our group at work to take advantage of this opportunity. If you’re considering the investment in a Technical Writing certificate, you might also want to check out a recent discussion on the Linkedin Software User Assistance forum.

If you don't have the time or money to invest in a longer program like this, you can still benefit from one or two classes. In the next post I'll talk about an alternative on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org) that I found very helpful.
